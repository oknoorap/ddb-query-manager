# What is DDB Query Manager

DDB Query Manager is a Chrome Extension that helps you to save and load query collections in an instant.

## How to Download

1. Go to [Release Page](https://github.com/oknoorap/ddb-query-manager/releases) and download latest version (download the `.crx` file).
2. Open your Chrome Browser.
3. Go to settings click Extensions in the left sidebar navigation or open `chrome://extensions/` directly on the address bar.
4. Drag and drop `.crx` file into the browser.

### Notes

Because DynamoDB is using single web application, the extension can't run automatically, you may need to load page manually `https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbv2/home?region=eu-central-1#item-explorer?initialTagKey=&table=YOUR_TABLE_NAME`
